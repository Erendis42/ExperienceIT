# ExperienceIT
ExperienceIT entry level project for oop

The task was to create a program which calculates the fewest notes and coins possible to represent a random amount of money in a random currency, write them to the console, result first, list afterwards, then create a file with a username read from the console and print the amount, the name of the currency and the time spent calculating them into it. (HUF and EUR was mandatory, I also added USD as an "extra mile").

Fun fact: Sweden also doesn't use change (just like Hungary), the smallest amount of money in cash is 1 krona (crown) (in Hungary the least money in cash is 5 forints).

Another fun fact: you can actually use [Java code as a filename](https://github.com/Erendis42/ExperienceIT/blob/master/oops.png) in GitHub (it converts comments into directory separators tho)
