ExperienceIT entry level project for oop

The task was to create a program which calculates the fewest notes and coins possible to represent a given amount of money in a given currency. (HUF, EUR, I also added USD as an "extra mile").

Fun fact: Sweden also doesn't use change (just like Hungary), the smallest amount of money in cash is 1 krona (crown) (in Hungary the least money in cash is 5 forints).
